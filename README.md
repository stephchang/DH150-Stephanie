# Website for recipes using already bought groceries
## Stephanie Chang - DH150 Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities: User Experience Design
*I want to create a website that increases convenience for middle-aged women, where they can select ingredients they already have and find recipes.*  

### **Supercook**
<img src="./supercook.png" width="50%">
<p> https://www.supercook.com/#/recipes </p>
<p> The website's purpose can be easily understood. It allows for its users to search up recipes using what they already have and shows many recipe options. However, the list to choose food items can be super long, making it hard to find ingredients one already has. </p>
<p> **Heuristics** </p>
<p> 1 Visibility of system status </p>
<p> Rating: 1 </p>
<p> - Once the user selects the ingredient, a green checkmark appears, showing that the ingredient is selected. </p>
<p> - When the ingredient category is expanded, the + that was originally there becomes a - . </p>
<p> - After clicking the ingredients, there isn't anything that indicates a loading screen. </p>
<p> 2 Match between system and the real world </p>

### **MyFridgeFood**

<p> The website can be used easily, with users being able to add ingredients. However, it is a little messy, making it hard to look for the recipes. </p>
