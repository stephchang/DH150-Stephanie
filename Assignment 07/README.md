## Graphic Design

**Version #1**

- Orange makes people feel happy and comfortable
- Wanted to use a paler orange rather than a bright or dark orange because that would look too bright or brown, but words seem harder to read
- Playfair typeface for a more professional look, but the serif font but feels like it's not modern enough

**Version #2**

- Green evokes feelings of healthiness but app isn't focused on healthy eating
- Wanted to use a brighter orange for friendly look, but also feels like it may be hard to read
- Poppins typeface is fun and modern, but I want a font with more character

**Version #3**

<img src="/Supercookv3-1.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv3-2.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv3-3.png" width="33%">

- Similar to the pink of original site, but more red
- Red causes feelings of emotion and passion, as well as hunger
- Toned down red so that it isn't too hard on the eye
- Karla typeface feels like the perfect medium between professional and fun with character, as well as seeming friendly

I played with the colors and fonts to see which I liked better. I looked into color theory as well, to see which colors evoke certain emotions in order to think about the users' emotions when using the site. Thus, I ended up with the red/pink color


## Impression Test

### Quotes & Insights
- "My first impression of the site is that it's very clean, bright, and friendly."
- "[I] can tell that it's a site used to find ingredients that you want to use or save"
- "Photos used for each recipe makes me understand what the food would look like...very professional looking."
- "Not intimidating at all."
- "Font is easy to read."
- "Very engaging and very pleasing to the eye."
- "Something I would want to use."


## Accessibility check

I checked my colors using the Able Figma Plugin, which lets you select layers to compare their color contrast. I saw that all my colors passed the AA test, which was good.
