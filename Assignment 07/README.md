# Assignment 07

## Project Description
### Summary

The current project aims to help users in finding recipes with food already in their refrigerator, reducing food waste and increasing convenience.

### Purpose & Process
This high fidelity prototype is created so I can test how the SuperCook site would function. Through the test, I can examine if the three features I edited/added based on the personas are functional and intuitive. 

The prototype was created with Figma. I started the project by creating low fidelity wireframes and mapping out where each component should be based off of my wireframe sketches, and made changes according to the test I conducted then. Then, I copied three main screens and put different colors and fonts onto them in order to see what style fits better with the website branding. After choosing the colors and fonts I wanted, I added interactions and tried them out on a separate screen to make sure the flow makes sense.

### Tasks
Ingredient search bar: 
- Use ingredient search bar to search for ingredient
- Select ingredient to find recipe 
- Find recipe that has ingredient in it 

Filter bar: 
- Find filter bar to narrow down searches
- Filter age to toddler
- Find a recipe that is suitable for toddlers

Grocery List: 
- Look for recipes you may want to cook
- Check if there's ingredients you're missing
- Add missing ingredient to your grocery list
- Check grocery list 

## Graphic Design

**Version #1**

<img src="/Supercookv1-1.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv1-2.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv1-3.png" width="33%">

- Orange makes people feel happy and comfortable
- Wanted to use a paler orange rather than a bright or dark orange because that would look too bright or brown, but words seem harder to read
- Playfair typeface for a more professional look, but the serif font but feels like it's not modern enough

**Version #2**

<img src="/Supercookv2-1.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv2-2.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv2-3.png" width="33%">

- Green evokes feelings of healthiness but app isn't focused on healthy eating
- Wanted to use a brighter orange for friendly look, but also feels like it may be hard to read
- Poppins typeface is fun and modern, but I want a font with more character

**Version #3**

<img src="/Supercookv3-1.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv3-2.png" width="33%"> <img src="/Supercookv3-3.png" width="33%">

- Similar to the pink of original site, but more red
- Red causes feelings of emotion and passion, as well as hunger
- Toned down red so that it isn't too hard on the eye
- Karla typeface feels like the perfect medium between professional and fun with character, as well as seeming friendly

I played with the colors and fonts to see which I liked better. I looked into color theory as well, to see which colors evoke certain emotions in order to think about the users' emotions when using the site. Thus, I ended up with the red/pink color


## Impression Test

### Quotes & Insights
- "My first impression of the site is that it's very clean, bright, and friendly."
- "[I] can tell that it's a site used to find ingredients that you want to use or save"
- "Photos used for each recipe makes me understand what the food would look like...very professional looking."
- "Not intimidating at all."
- "Font is easy to read."
- "Very engaging and very pleasing to the eye."
- "Something I would want to use."


## Accessibility check

I checked my colors using the Able Figma Plugin, which lets you select layers to compare their color contrast. I saw that all my colors passed the AA test, which was good.

## Cognitive Walkthrough

Key Findings:
- People seemed to know what site is about right away 
- Good comment on the colors
- Having two searches may be confusing to user
- Consider a wider range for age filter
- Add search icon
- Keep searched ingredient when you go back to homepage (changed on wireflow!)

## Reflection
Creating the high-fidelity prototype was incredibly rewarding, watching what I've been working on the whole quarter become a clickable prototype and have users interact with it like a real site. Because each detail and feature was added or edited with research and thought behind it, I was pretty happy with the prototype I ended up with. Additionally, the cognitive walkthrough was helpful, as people I didn't know commented and tested my site, so I know that it isn't biased.
