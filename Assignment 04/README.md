# Assignment 04: Users in context
## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 
### What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
My project would help users in finding recipes with food already in their refrigerator, reducing food waste and making cooking easier.
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for food because they can learn to make meals with the website. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are currently recipe books and online recipe websites.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
When looking up recipes in books or websites, you usually find the recipe first and buy the ingredients. Digital technology can add the feature of looking up recipes through ingredients so that one can explore new meals with what ingredients they already have.

## Step02: Target users 
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: Working adults, college students
Preference: Wants to save money, Looks for convenience
Expertise: Can cook
### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users will most likely be searching for recipes in the kitchen near the refrigerator to see what they already have. If they already marked what they have, they could be anywhere searching for recipes.
### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
The goal of the activity is to cook a meal with ingredients the user already has. They can do this by checking their refrigerator for ingredients, finding a recipe, preparing the ingredients, and cooking the meal.

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
### Method
- I decided to use participatory observation and interview.
- For participatory observation, I observed finding a recipe. 
- This observation and interview was conducted via Zoom, with the user in their own home at their desk. 
- I used my laptop and recorded on Zoom to record the user task.

### Here are some insights from the interview:
- **User's reason for choosing one recipe over the other** (6:36): "I definitely look at the photos. If the photos are like aesthetically pleasing, I'll definitely choose that  one over another, like really low quality photo because personally, I, I like, I, I prefer like seeing like, well done photos to get my recipes from and also how well the recipe is written because there's sometimes there's ones where the steps are very vague and I feel like that doesn't help me cook. So definitely something more detailed."
- **User's consideration of ingredients when choosing recipes** (7:48): "Sometimes like the recipes, I don't have certain ingredients, but if there's  one recipe ingredient lists, that's closer to what I have, then I'll use that  one."
- **Helpful features to help user find recipes** (14:39) : "I think that would be cool if I could have like a, I dunno, a sticky note or something where I can put all the, I found into like a singular place. So in my case I might just use like the Apple notes app and put like recipes I find in like one section. So I'll like, oh pho, these are all the pho recipe I found. And I think it would be like a nice way to like keep everything together."
- **Sentiments around cooking** (15:39) : "I think it's fun. Cause it's like a stress relief for me. Uh, sometimes I don't want to cook, but that's because like I'm really tired and I just don't want to prepare all my ingredients to cook and like look up a recipe."
- **How user decides what to cook when they're struggling to decide** (18:28) : "I think it's really just like me opening the fridge and saying, Oh, I have eggs and tomato. Okay. Then maybe I can make something out of that."
- **User's response when she struggles to think of dishes with refrigerator items** (19:13) :"I kind of give up looking for a recipe and just cook whatever I can and do like a blind taste look, blind taste test to see if it tastes good, because at this point I feel like it's really hard to find like a certain recipe to cook off from." "I am very lazy when it comes to [running to the grocery store to get missing ingredients]"
- **The user's ranking of finding a recipe** 20:19 : " 8... Because I'm someone who really likes to follow the rules. Like I'm kind of conventional in a way that I like having steps that I can follow. And I know for sure that this dish will be a success because that way I know like, Oh, my ingredients aren't going to money are going to waste."

## Step06: Relfection
The contextual inquiry was super insightful, as it allowed me to observe the user naturally as they did a task that they do in their daily life. This is unlike the usability test, where I gave them very specific tasks to do, which made it feel less natural.
