# Assignment 04: Users in context
## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 
### What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
My project would help users in finding recipes with food already in their refrigerator, reducing food waste and making cooking easier.
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for food because they can learn to make meals with the website. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are currently recipe books and online recipe websites.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
When looking up recipes in books or websites, you usually find the recipe first and buy the ingredients. Digital technology can add the feature of looking up recipes through ingredients so that one can explore new meals with what ingredients they already have.

## Step02: Target users 
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: Working adults, college students
Preference: Wants to save money, Looks for convenience
Expertise: Can cook
### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users will most likely be searching for recipes in the kitchen near the refrigerator to see what they already have. If they already marked what they have, they could be anywhere searching for recipes.
### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
The goal of the activity is to cook a meal with ingredients the user already has. They can do this by checking their refrigerator for ingredients, finding a recipe, preparing the ingredients, and cooking the meal.

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
## Method
- I decided to 
Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)
