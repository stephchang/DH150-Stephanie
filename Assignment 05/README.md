## User Scenarios and Journey Maps
### Mary Poppin's Scenario
**Why**

Mary is a mother of two and wants to do the most to make her kids happy and healthy.  However, she has never learned how to cook so she only knows how to make 5 dishes, which her kids get tired of and arenâ€™t the healthiest. She tries to buy lots of ingredients to attempt to add to the dishes she knows how to make, but it always fails so some ingredients go bad in the fridge. Thus, she wants to know how to learn how to cook and make new dishes using the ingredients she buys. She also wants to make sure the dishes are suitable for kids.

**How**

To cook breakfast for her kids, Mary turns on her personal laptop and goes onto the SuperCook site. She opens her fridge and looks at all the ingredients she has. She has chicken breasts, american cheese, onions, green beans, spinach, ground beef, flour, sugar, potato, vegetable oil, and olive oil. She presses on the categories, which expand and shows ingredients. She proceeds and marks all the ingredients she has in her fridge using the checkbox beside each of them. As she does so, the page refreshes to show the recipe of dishes she can make. The page shows that she can make 900+ dishes with her 11 ingredients. Mary sees that there are so many options and is intimidated. She notices that there is a filter on the page, and clicks on age range to narrow down her searches. She is able to select toddler & preschool to identify what age range her kids are in. This way, she is able to make sure these dishes are suitable for her kids. Once she selects the filters, the page refreshes, and narrows down the recipes to displays ones that are safe for her kids. She clicks on the picture of the first one, potato pancakes, which opens a new tab that brings her to the recipe page. She brings out all the ingredients that are required for the recipe and follows the recipe to make the dish. Her dish is a success and she wakes her kids up to eat breakfast. Her kids are delighted to see that it is a new dish and love it. Mary is happy and satisfied that her kids seem to like the new dish she has made.

#### Ingredients search bar
**Why**

Kevin is a busy consultant living in the city of New York. He is an adventurous foodie and enjoys trying new foods. He also loves cooking new dishes and wants to attempt to cook new dishes. However, he is always busy with work, so he doesn't like to do things that take long. He just came back from his grocery shopping trip and wants to find a new recipe to make. He only has 1.5 hours to find a recipe and cook, so he wants this process to fast and easy. 

**How**

Kevin uses his personal desktop and goes onto SuperCook. He starts to mark all the ingredients that he has bought by clicking on the category that expands, and then marking the box next to the ingredient. However, it takes Kevin a while to search for the ingredients he has. He becomes frustrated because time is running out and he needs to go back to working. Kevin notices that there is a search bar above the categories, so he starts typing his ingredients there. When he starts typing, the search bar autopopulates possible ingredients that he is searching for so that he can input the ingredient this way. Kevin is satisfied because the search bar makes the process of inputting ingredients faster. He successfully inputs all the ingredients he has. The page shows all the recipes using his ingredients, and he selects one to make.

#### Grocery List
**Why**

Kevin is a busy consultant living in the city of New York. He is an adventurous foodie and enjoys trying new foods. He also loves cooking new dishes and wants to attempt to cook new dishes. However, he is always busy with work, so he doesn't go on gorcery runs often. Thus, he can't buy new ingredients often to try new dishes. When he's shopping, he can never recall what he has in his refrigerator and always feels like he already has an ingredient at home. However, when he gets home, he finds that he always misses certain ingredients that the recipe says he needs, making him unable to make the dish. He wants to be able to remember all the missing ingredients he has to buy at the grocery store. 

**How**

Kevin plans to go grocery shopping after work tomorrow. He goes onto his personal desktop and browses through the recipes he can make. Kevin sees that there are recipes on the page which indicates in red what ingredients he is missing. He tries to make a mental note of what ingredients he will need to buy tomorrow, but is worried that he might forget some of them like he always does. Kevin notices that there is a plus next to the ingredient. When he hovers over it, it says add to grocery list. He clicks the plus sign and there is a small pop up that says added to grocery list. Kevin notices that there is a tab on the navigation bar that says grocery list. He clicks on the grocery list, which shows all the missing ingredients he has added. He takes a screenshot of this list. The next day when he goes to the grocery store, he is able to check his photos to see the missing ingredients list. He buys all the ingredients that he had added on there.  When Kevin arrives home, he is happy to see that he has all the ingredients in order to make dishes he wants.
