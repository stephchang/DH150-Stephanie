### Mary Poppin's Scenario
**Why**
Mary is a mother of two and wants to do the most to make her kids happy and healthy.  However, she has never learned how to cook so she only knows how to make 5 dishes, which her kids get tired of and aren’t the healthiest. Because she is busy taking care of her kids, she doesn’t have time to take cooking classes or even risk trying new dishes that may fail and take more time. She tries to buy lots of ingredients to attempt to add to the dishes she knows how to make, but it always fails so some ingredients go bad in the fridge. Thus, she wants to know how to learn how to cook and make new dishes using the ingredients she buys. She also wants to make sure the dishes are healthy for her kids. 

**How**
To cook breakfast, Mary turns on her personal laptop and goes onto the SuperCook site. She opens her fridge and looks at all the ingredients she has. She has chicken breasts, american cheese, onions, green beans, spinach, ground beef, flour, sugar, potato, vegetable oil, and olive oil. She goes through the categories of ingredients to marks all the ingredients she has in her fridge. As she marks the ingredients, the page refreshes to show the recipe of dishes she can make. The page shows that she can make 961  dishes with her 11 ingredients. Because she wants to make sure these dishes are suitable for her kids, she clicks on meal type in the top bar. Then, she selects the Kid Friendly option for meal type, which filters her searchs to 58 dishes. Mary is excited to see 58 options she can choose from to make a kid-friendly meal. She clicks on the picture of the first one, potato pancakes, which opens a new tab that brings her to the recipe page. She brings out all the ingredients that are required for the recipe and follows the recipe to make the dish. Her dish is a success and she wakes her kids up to eat breakfast. Her kids are delighted to see that it is a new dish and love it. Mary is happy and satisfied that her kids seem to like the new dish she has made.
