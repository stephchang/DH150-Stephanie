# Assignment 02: Usability Testing- Stephanie Chang
## Introduction
**Supercook** is a website used to find recipes with ingerdients you already have at home. One does not need an account to browse for recipes, but in order to favorite recipes, you would need to create an account. 

After conducting heuristic evaluation, a number of usability issues stood out to me. 
-  The flexibility and efficiency of use is poor, because even though functions exist to make the site more efficient, the website does a poor job of making it clear where to find these functions. Thus, users cannot efficiently navigate the website and may find it hard to use.
- There is no internal consistency, as there are many ways to add or remove the ingredients and many icons that perform this action. Additionally, there is not a consistent color that shows what is an actionable item or link and what is not. Therefore, the lack of consistency may be confusing for the user.
- The website does not have an aesthetic or minimalistic design, as it appears quite messy, showing irrelevant information. This may convey a bad impression for the user and lead them to not use the site.
- The user control and freedom is lacking, as there is no clear way on how to start over with ingredients or filters. Although the clear all button exists, it is not obvious. 

## Methodology
In order to confirm my evaluations, I conducted a usability test in order to find out how to improve the website from the user's perspective, using certain tasks to see how users navigate the site. The UT will test the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the site. 

My three tasks were:
1. Find a dish using ingredients you already have
2. Find out if you can make a certain type of dish after updating your ingredients list
3. Bookmark a dish after adding ingredients Supercook suggests

I moderated the test with my sister as the user via Zoom, and had us both situated in a quiet room. We both used our personal laptops, and I had her share her screen so I could record what she was doing through Zoom. 

**Process of the Usability Test**
- Introduction
- Informed Consent
- Background Questions
- Pre-Test Questions
- Task Scenarios
- Post-Test Questions
- System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Product Satisfction Card
- Demographics

The **Pre-Test Questions** measured the user's first impressions of the Supercook website homepage. The **Task Scenarios** allowed me to observe how the user navigates the site and his/her ability to complete  tasks on the site. The **Post-Test Questions** measures the user's experience using the site, evaluating its ease of use, efficiency of use, expected frequency of use, learnability, degree of satisfaction, and learnability. The **System Usability Scale** measures the user's attitude towards the website. The **Production Satisfaction Cards** determine how the website made the user feel to provide more insight on the attitude of the user towards the website.

## Reflection
The usability test went smoothly apart from minor technical difficulties in the beginning. I was able to gain some insight and confirm some of the usability issues I identified through the heuristic evaluation. For example, I was able to see that that the site was not very efficient or clear, as the user struggled to find the search bar and never accessed the "Type" tab. It was interesting to see how every user is different, and that the usability test revealed some things that I did not notice, while some things I felt like were a usability issue were not seen by the user. Something that I would want to improve on in the future is my tasks and the way I word them. I realized that the way I worded one of my tasks created confusion, as it was inconsistent with the site. Additionally, I feel like there could be better tasks that I could come up with the confirm my evaluations. On top of the tasks, I also want to be more conversational during my usability tests, as sometimes I would struggle with encouraging the user to talk about their thoughts. Overall, it was a good pilot usability test that helped me gain more insight on conducting usability tests.
