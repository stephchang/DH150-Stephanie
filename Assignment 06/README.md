# Assignment 06
## Project Description
### User Research
The current project aims to help users in finding recipes with food already in their refrigerator, reducing food waste and increasing convenience. From my user research, I found that people value convenience and consider ingredients when choosing recipes. This information informed me when coming up with my personas and features to focus on.

### Personas
My two personas were a mom who wanted to learn to make healthy dishes for her kids and a working man who wanted to find recipes efficiently and remember ingredients he needs. 

### Three Features
1. Filter bar
2. Ingredient search bar
3. Grocery List

### Purpose
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype was to test if the flows made sense and the features were functional for when people search for recipes using ingredients.

## Wireframes & Wireflow

After wireframing, I conducted a test with a friend to see the wireflow made sense.

### Takeaways
- **Task #1** : The user noticed both find recipes and popular recipes, but decided to click "see all" for the find recipes. Because she considered both of them, it made me think about changing how the starting page looked so users won't be confused at first between the two when searching up ingredients. For the filter bar itself, the user found the bar and age filter fast and selected the toddler option in order to find kid-friendly meals.
- **Task #2**: The user easily idenitified the ingredient search bar and selects the ingredients.
- **Task #3**: The user hesitated for a bit when when adding missing ingredients to the grocery list. It might have been because of the small print and icon, but it took some time to find it. This made me make a note that I should make sure users know that the button is a call to action and find a way so that users are aware of the grocery list feature. For viewing the grocery list, the user found the icon to do so pretty fast. 

## Reflection
Creating the low-fidelity prototype was very helpful for me, as I when I started creating the sketches, I found that many ideas I had before wouldn't work well. For example, I previously wanted to display all the categories of the ingredients below the search bar, but then I realized that there wouldn't be any space to display what ingredient the user has selected. Because knowing what ingredients is already selected is more important and users will most likely know the names of ingredients they bought, I removed the categories. Just in case they forget, I added a "Forgot ingredient name?" call to action below, which would allow users to search by photo or category to recall what the ingredient is named. Additionally, I also found that there were many details I didn't consider at first, such as what users will see before they add ingredients, how to display used and missing ingredients, etc. The wireframes made me think about how to layout these things to better serve the user, which is why it was super helpful! 
Because the low-fidelity prototype took a long time to create, I hope to try out low-fidelity wireframing on digital platforms like invision. I feel like the process may be faster because many screens were the same with small changes, so copying and pasting would make the process faster. This was also my first time trying out a user test through pen and paper sketches, which was a cool experience. It definitely served the same purpose, as I was still able to get key insights which will inform changes I will make with the high-fidelity prototypes. From this experience, I got to see why prototypes, which can take on many forms, are so useful.
