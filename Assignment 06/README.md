## Project Description
### User Research
The current project aims to help users in finding recipes with food already in their refrigerator, reducing food waste and increasing convenience. From my user research, I found that people value convenience and consider ingredients when choosing recipes. This information informed me when coming up with my personas and features to focus on.

### Personas
My two personas were a mom who wanted to learn to make healthy dishes for her kids and a working man who wanted to find recipes efficiently and remember ingredients he needs. 

### Three Features
1. Filter bar
2. Ingredient search bar
3. Grocery List

### Purpose
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype was to test if the flows made sense and the features were functional for when people search for recipes using ingredients.
