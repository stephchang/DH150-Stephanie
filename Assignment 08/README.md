# SuperCook Website Redesign
**Stephanie Chang**

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Super cook is a website where users can select ingredients they already have and find recipes for dishes with their ingredients they have. However, I found that the user experience wasn't the most intuitive and pleasant, so I set out to improve the site.


## Clear design statement: 
Many individuals are busy and may not have time or energy to go grocery shop often, such as middle-aged woman who have kids. However, they may still want to try new dishes to cook. Because many sites and websites have you input the dish before looking at what ingredients it uses, this may increase the time that individuals spend searching for recipes they can make.

This led me to ask: *How might we design a platform that assists busy individuals in finding recipes with ingredients they have?*

SuperCook aims to help individuals in finding recipes just for them with ingredients already in their refrigerator, increasing convenience and efficiency. 


## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:

I conducted a heuristics evaluation of the SuperCook website and the MyFridgeFood website, using Jakob Nielson's 10 heuristics. By looking at these two websites, I was able to analyze the user experience of the sites and pick out the flaws.With the SuperCook website, I found that the main problems of the site were with user control and freedom, consistency, and the aesthetic design of the page. With the MyFridgeFood site, the flexibility and efficiency of use and the aesthetic design were the main problems.
