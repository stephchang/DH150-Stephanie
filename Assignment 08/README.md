# SuperCook Website Redesign
**Stephanie Chang**

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Super cook is a website where users can select ingredients they already have and find recipes for dishes with their ingredients they have. However, I found that the user experience wasn't the most intuitive and pleasant, so I set out to improve the site.


## Clear design statement: 
Many individuals are busy and may not have time or energy to go grocery shop often, such as middle-aged woman who have kids. However, they may still want to try new dishes to cook. Because many sites and websites have you input the dish before looking at what ingredients it uses, this may increase the time that individuals spend searching for recipes they can make.

This led me to ask: *How might we design a platform that assists busy individuals in finding recipes with ingredients they have?*
