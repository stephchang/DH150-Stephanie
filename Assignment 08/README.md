# SuperCook Website Redesign
**Stephanie Chang**

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Super cook is a website where users can select ingredients they already have and find recipes for dishes with their ingredients they have. However, I found that the user experience wasn't the most intuitive and pleasant, so I set out to improve the site.


## Clear design statement: 
Many individuals are busy and may not have time or energy to go grocery shop often, such as middle-aged woman who have kids. However, they may still want to try new dishes to cook. Because many sites and websites have you input the dish before looking at what ingredients it uses, this may increase the time that individuals spend searching for recipes they can make.

This led me to ask: *How might we design a platform that assists busy individuals in finding recipes with ingredients they have?*

SuperCook aims to help individuals in finding recipes just for them with ingredients already in their refrigerator, increasing convenience and efficiency. 


## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:

I conducted a heuristics evaluation of the SuperCook website and the MyFridgeFood website, using Jakob Nielson's 10 heuristics. By looking at these two websites, I was able to analyze the user experience of the sites and pick out the flaws.With the SuperCook website, I found that the main problems of the site were with user control and freedom, consistency, and the aesthetic design of the page. With the MyFridgeFood site, the flexibility and efficiency of use and the aesthetic design were the main problems.

After my own evaluation, in order to confirm them, I conducted a usability test in order to find out how to improve the website from the user's perspective, using certain tasks to see how users navigate the site. The UT tested the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the site.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:

In order to better understand the users, I conducted contextual research. I used two methods: an interview and participatory observation. For this contexual inquiry, I asked the participant to find a recipe they were going to use to prepare their lunch. I learned that users value convenience, giving up on a recipe if they don't have an ingredient for it instead of running to the grocery store. Additionally, I learned about the importance of ingredients when in comes to choosing recipes, looking at ingredients first when considering different recipes.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
In order to empathize with the user and put myself in their shoes, I created user personas, empathy maps, scenarios and journey maps. This way, I was able to gain insight on the user, their behavior, story, and pain points.

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
To start, I created sketches of the screens and created wireflows of the three features I wanted to focus on: the ingredients search bar, grocery list, and filter. This low-fidelity prototype allowed me to test if the flows made sense and if the features were functional for when people search for recipes using ingredients.

After refining my wireframes, I conducted a wireflow test to make sure that the user would be able to follow the flow. From this test, I was able to further reiterate on my prototype to make it more intutive to the user. Below is the marked up photo after the user had tested it.

I copied three main screens and played with the colors and fonts to see which I liked better. I looked into color theory to see which colors evoke certain emotions in order to think about the users' emotions when using the site. Thus, I ended up with the red color because red causes feelings of emotion and passion, as well as hunger. I made sure to tone down the red so that it isn't too hard on the eye. I originally chose the Karla typeface, but it had accessibility issues and uneven tracking. Thus, I switched to the Lora typeface in my final prototype, because I felt like it was professional yet friendly.

## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
After making sure that the user understood the interaction flow, I started digitalizing my sketches, first from low-fidelity to high-fidelity. The prototype was created with Figma. I started the project by creating low fidelity wireframes and mapping out where each component should be based off of my wireframe sketches, and made changes according to the test I conducted then. Then, I copied three main screens and put different colors and fonts onto them in order to see what style fits better with the website branding. After choosing the colors and fonts I wanted, I added interactions and tried them out on a separate screen to make sure the flow makes sense.

## Optional evaluation and revision history 

In order to continue iterating on my prototype to make sure that it is intuitive and usable, I conducted impression test, cognitive walkthrough, accessibility audit, and usability testing. 

In order to make sure the site is accessbile to everyone, even those with visual impairments, I conducted an accessbility audit to make sure that my colors pass the color contrast test, which they did.

The impression test was used to test the first impressions users have of the site, seeing how they feel about it and if they understand the purpose of the site. From my impression test, I found that the purpose of it was easily identified, engaging and friendly, and easy to read.

From the cognitive walkthroughs, users tested the flow of the site. From this, I found that people also knew what the site is about right away and liked the colors. Users also gave some useful critiques, like how I should consider not just children for the age filter, add search icon on search bar so that it's more recognizable right away, and how the searched ingredient dissappears when going back to homepage, messing up the flow.

All of these evaluations allowed me to revise my prototype into the high-fidelity prototype shown above.

## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?

I believe that in the end, I was able to make a prototype of a site that reached the goals that I had in mind, solving problems that my personas had. 

- **Importance of research and tests:** The whole process took a long time, with intensive research and tests, but through that, I was able to really understand and empathize the with users that would use the site. I got to learn about how to evaluate sites and prototypes through different methods, like heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability tests. I was definitely nervous for them, as I was unsure if I was doing them right at first. All the research and tests informed my decisions as I was making the site, so I got to see how important they were in understanding the user. 

- **Efficiency of digital programs:** Through this project, I learned how to use different programs, such as Invision and Figma. I found that it was a lot faster with these to create prototypes, as I was able to copy and paste instead of redrawing the same frame and frame over again. Thus, I learned how powerful and efficient these digital programs are.

- **Check on accessibility:** Previously, I didn't think much about accessibility. However, through this class, I got to see how important it is to make sure that the site will be accessible to everyone. I think that it's pretty easy to forget about color contrast, as text is visible to me personally. However, it is important to make sure that this is the case for anyone who views my site, such as those who may have visual impairment. I learned to use tools to check on accessibility, as I want to make sure that my site is inclusive!

If I were to continue to work on this project, I would definitely do more usability tests to see how different users react to my prototype. Because there are so many different types of users, I want to see if my site addresses the majority's needs. 
Overall, this project was super rewarding, as I got to design a website from scratch and see the whole process of UI/UX design. I throroughly enjoyed it and believe that I've gained a lot from this project in terms of knowledge and experience with the field.
