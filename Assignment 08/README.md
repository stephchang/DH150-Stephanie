# SuperCook Website Redesign
**Stephanie Chang**

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Super cook is a website where users can select ingredients they already have and find recipes for dishes with their ingredients they have. However, I found that the user experience wasn't the most intuitive and pleasant, so I set out to improve the site.


## Clear design statement: 
Many individuals are busy and may not have time or energy to go grocery shop often, such as middle-aged woman who have kids. However, they may still want to try new dishes to cook. Because many sites and websites have you input the dish before looking at what ingredients it uses, this may increase the time that individuals spend searching for recipes they can make.

This led me to ask: *How might we design a platform that assists busy individuals in finding recipes with ingredients they have?*

SuperCook aims to help individuals in finding recipes just for them with ingredients already in their refrigerator, increasing convenience and efficiency. 


## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:

I conducted a heuristics evaluation of the SuperCook website and the MyFridgeFood website, using Jakob Nielson's 10 heuristics. By looking at these two websites, I was able to analyze the user experience of the sites and pick out the flaws.With the SuperCook website, I found that the main problems of the site were with user control and freedom, consistency, and the aesthetic design of the page. With the MyFridgeFood site, the flexibility and efficiency of use and the aesthetic design were the main problems.

After my own evaluation, in order to confirm them, I conducted a usability test in order to find out how to improve the website from the user's perspective, using certain tasks to see how users navigate the site. The UT tested the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the site.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:

In order to better understand the users, I conducted contextual research. I used two methods: an interview and participatory observation. For this contexual inquiry, I asked the participant to find a recipe they were going to use to prepare their lunch. I learned that users value convenience, giving up on a recipe if they don't have an ingredient for it instead of running to the grocery store. Additionally, I learned about the importance of ingredients when in comes to choosing recipes, looking at ingredients first when considering different recipes.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
In order to empathize with the user and put myself in their shoes, I created user personas, empathy maps, scenarios and journey maps. This way, I was able to gain insight on the user, their behavior, story, and pain points.

## Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
To start, I created sketches of the screens and created wireflows of the three features I wanted to focus on: the ingredients search bar, grocery list, and filter. This low-fidelity prototype allowed me to test if the flows made sense and if the features were functional for when people search for recipes using ingredients.

After refining my wireframes, I conducted a wireflow test to make sure that the user would be able to follow the flow. From this test, I was able to further reiterate on my prototype to make it more intutive to the user. Below is the marked up photo after the user had tested it.

## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
After making sure that the user understood the interaction flow, I started digitalizing my sketches, first from low-fidelity to high-fidelity. The prototype was created with Figma. I started the project by creating low fidelity wireframes and mapping out where each component should be based off of my wireframe sketches, and made changes according to the test I conducted then. Then, I copied three main screens and put different colors and fonts onto them in order to see what style fits better with the website branding. After choosing the colors and fonts I wanted, I added interactions and tried them out on a separate screen to make sure the flow makes sense.
